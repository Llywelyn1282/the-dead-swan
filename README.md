### Future Implementations

### Accessibility

I have been mindful during coding to ensure that the website is as accessible friendly as possible. This has been achieved by:

* Using semantic HTML.
* Using descriptive alt attributes and titles for images on the site.
* Providing information for screen readers where there are icons used and no text.
* Adding "current" to navigation for screen reader to inform of page being accessed.
* Ensuring that there is a sufficient colour contrast throughout the site.
